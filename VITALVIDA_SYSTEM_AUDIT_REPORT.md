## üìã **AUDIT COMPLETION SUMMARY**

### **Overall Progress Assessment**

**Phase 1 Foundation**: 35% Complete

**Priority Areas for Completion**:
1. Complete pending database migrations (9 tables)
2. Implement portal-specific controllers (6 controllers)
3. Create portal-specific models with relationships
4. Set up proper API routes with authentication
5. Implement file upload functionality
6. Create role-based middleware system

**Ready for Phase 2 Development**: ‚ùå No

**Major Blockers Identified**:
- Database migration conflicts (permissions/personal_access_tokens tables)
- Missing portal-specific models and controllers
- No proper API route structure for portal features
- File upload system not implemented
- Role-based access control incomplete

**Immediate Next Steps**:
1. Resolve migration conflicts and complete database schema
2. Create missing portal models with proper relationships
3. Implement portal-specific controllers with CRUD operations
4. Set up protected API routes with role-based middleware
5. Implement file upload functionality for receipts/proofs
6. Create comprehensive test suite
